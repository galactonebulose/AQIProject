## Introduction

Air pollution has emerged as one of the most significant environmental health risks globally, affecting billions of people and contributing to approximately 7 million premature deaths annually. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies air pollution as a critical risk factor for non-communicable diseases, accounting for an estimated 25% of all adult deaths from heart disease, 24% from stroke, 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 29% from lung cancer.

### Background and Significance

Air quality monitoring has evolved significantly over the past several decades, transitioning from manual sampling methods to sophisticated electronic sensor networks. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was developed as a standardized numerical scale to communicate how polluted the air is and what associated health effects might be experienced after breathing polluted air.

In India, the National Air Quality Index (NAQI) was launched in 2014 by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to provide comprehensive information on air quality. The Indian AQI considers eight pollutants and categorizes air quality into six categories ranging from "Good" to "Severe."

### Need for Computerized AQI Management

Traditional air quality monitoring approaches face several limitations:

1. **Data Integration Challenges**: Air quality data often exists in siloed systems, making it difficult to correlate with other environmental and health parameters.

2. **Delayed Reporting**: Manual data collection and processing methods result in significant delays between measurement and public reporting.

3. **Limited Accessibility**: Air quality information is frequently presented in technical formats that are not readily understandable by the general public.

4. **Geographical Coverage Gaps**: Monitoring networks often prioritize urban centers, creating information gaps for rural and peri-urban areas.

5. **Inadequate Health Advisory Systems**: Generic health advisories fail to account for individual vulnerability factors and specific pollutant compositions.

### System Overview

The proposed AQI Management System adopts a three-tier architecture consisting of:

- **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces tailored to different stakeholders
- **Application Layer**: Business logic components that process raw sensor data, calculate AQI values, and generate health advisories
- **Data Layer**: A comprehensive database management system that stores and organizes air quality measurements

## Objectives and Problem Statement

### Problem Statement

Air quality monitoring in urban and rural areas faces significant challenges including:

- Fragmented data collection systems with limited interoperability
- Delays in processing and disseminating air quality information
- Generic health advisories that don't account for individual vulnerability
- Limited citizen engagement in environmental monitoring
- Inadequate integration of meteorological data with pollution measurements

These challenges impact the effectiveness of public health interventions and limit public awareness of air quality issues.

### Primary Objectives

The AQI Management System aims to:

1. **Database Management**: Design and implement a comprehensive database structure for efficient management of air quality data across multiple locations.

2. **Data Integration**: Establish relationships between environmental parameters, geographic information, and health implications.

3. **Personalized Health Advisories**: Enable customized health advisories based on air quality measurements and user demographics.

4. **Public Engagement**: Facilitate public engagement through feedback mechanisms that improve system responsiveness.

5. **Policy Support**: Support evidence-based policy development by providing reliable air quality information to decision-makers.

6. **Scalability**: Create a scalable framework that can accommodate both urban and rural monitoring requirements.

### Sustainable Development Goals Alignment

This system supports **Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** by providing crucial environmental data for public health decisions and aligns with India's sustainable urban development through improved air quality management infrastructure.

## Data Design

### Database Schema Architecture

The AQI Management System database schema consists of six primary tables with their respective attributes:

#### Core Tables

**1. Users Table**
- Primary Key: UserID
- Attributes: FirstName, LastName, Password (hashed), AccountStatus, Mail, PhoneNumber
- Purpose: Stores authentication credentials and contact information for system users

**2. City Table**
- Primary Key: CityID
- Attributes: Name, State, Urban_Rural classification, Lat_Long (coordinates), Population
- Purpose: Maintains geographic and demographic information about monitored locations

**3. Monitoring Station Table**
- Primary Key: StationID
- Attributes: Lat_Long (precise coordinates), Active_Time, DateOfInstallation, AQI (current reading)
- Purpose: Represents physical air quality monitoring equipment and their current status

**4. Weather Table**
- Primary Key: WeatherID
- Attributes: Temp, Humidity, WindSpeed, Rainfall, Timestamp, Category
- Purpose: Stores meteorological readings associated with air quality measurements

**5. Health Advice Table**
- Primary Key: AdvisoryID
- Attributes: HealthEffects, Precautions, AgeAffected
- Purpose: Contains health recommendations based on pollution levels for different demographic groups

**6. Feedback Table**
- Foreign Key: UserID (references Users)
- Attributes: Comments, Date, Gives (relationship identifier)
- Purpose: Captures user comments and suggestions about air quality readings

### Entity-Relationship Model

The ER diagram depicts conceptual data organization through:

- **Entities**: Six primary entities (Users, City, Monitoring Station, Weather, Health Advice, Feedback)
- **Relationships**: 
  - "Gives": Users provide Feedback (one-to-many)
  - "Belongs To": Users are associated with Cities (many-to-many)
  - "Monitored": Cities are monitored by Stations (one-to-many)
  - "Gets": Stations receive Weather data (one-to-many)
  - "Advises": Health Advisory system advises users (one-to-many)

### Normalization Process

The database has been normalized to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) through these steps:

1. **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Eliminated repeating groups and ensured all attributes contain atomic values
2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Removed partial dependencies on composite keys
3. **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Eliminated transitive dependencies
4. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: Ensured every determinant is a candidate key

This normalization approach minimizes data redundancy while maintaining data integrity through properly defined foreign key relationships.

### Key Database Functions

**Environmental Parameter Aggregation Functions:**
- Humidity Analysis: Calculates city-specific average humidity
- Temperature Analysis: Computes mean temperature using multi-table joins
- AQI Calculation: Derives average air quality index by correlating cities with monitoring stations

**Health Advisory Generation Procedure:**
- AQI Range Matching: Compares city's average AQI against stored advisory thresholds
- Dynamic Recommendation: Returns precautionary measures and risk levels
- Error Handling: Implements exception management for missing data scenarios
